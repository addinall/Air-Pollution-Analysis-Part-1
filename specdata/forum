I am a bit lost.  Don't want answers, but I don't really understand (even after reading the help and forums for a while) just what the cor() function is doing, and especially in regards to our assignment.  

    cr <- corr("specdata", 150)
    head(cr)
    [1] -0.01896 -0.14051 -0.04390 -0.06816 -0.12351 -0.07589
    summary(cr)
    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
    -0.2110 -0.0500  0.0946  0.1250  0.2680  0.7630

That is what is EXPECTED.  What type of data object is cr?  I thought that R always forced coercion to a function result?  I really don't have the foggyest WHAT values I am supposed to be testing, so I thought I would just experiment with a few things and have a look-see.  My (incorrect obviously) end code...  
  

    result <- cor(correlation$sulfate, correlation$nitrate)

    return(result)

My run results against expected gives:  

    > cr <- corr("specdata", 150)
    > head(cr)
    [1] 0.06088486
    > summary(cr)

    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 

    0.06088 0.06088 0.06088 0.06088 0.06088 0.06088 

cr doesn't even look the same shape as the expected result!Any examples to look at?  I worked through the practice OK.  And used the methods in there (more or less) to produce the HUGE table full of interesting data, then ran into a stop sign.  

Hints?  
  
Cheers,  
Mark.
