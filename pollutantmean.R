## Date         : 08/08/2014
## Author       : Mark Addinall
## Synopsis     : This file is part of the course work
##                assignments for the Johns Hopkins
##                series of Data Science units.
##                This unit is R Programming
## Expected output
## source("pollutantmean.R")
##	pollutantmean("specdata", "sulfate", 1:10)
## 	[1] 4.064
##	pollutantmean("specdata", "nitrate", 70:72)
## 	[1] 1.706
##	pollutantmean("specdata", "nitrate", 23)
## 	[1] 1.281

## --------------------------------------
clean_table <- function(table, columns) {

## this funtion iterates through a data table and
## removes whole rows based on the validity of
## one or more identified COLUMNS.  So if we have
## a NaN in foo in a record, but we only care about
## the value in bar, maintain the record in the data set.
## If bar is NaN, remove the entire row.
##
## input:  table
## output: table MINUS bad records

      clean_rows <- complete.cases(table[, columns])
        return(table[clean_rows, ])
}



## -----------------------------------------------------------------
pollutantmean <- function(directory = ".", pollutant, id = 1:332) {

## 'directory' is a character vector of length 1 indicating
## the location of the CSV files

## 'pollutant' is a character vector of length 1 indicating
## the name of the pollutant for which we will calculate the
## mean; either "sulfate" or "nitrate".

## 'id' is an integer vector indicating the monitor ID numbers
## to be used

## Return the mean of the pollutant across all monitors list
## in the 'id' vector (ignoring NA values)


## first build a file list
## what we are doing in this line is using the paste
## function to iterate over the id vector, applying
## the function of sprintf to each iteration to 
## pad that portion of the string as "000".."00n".
##
## we also use this iteration to build the fully qualified
## file name "specdata/005.csv" etc., and return them
## in the vector files.

    files <- paste( directory,"/", 
                    sprintf("%03d", as.numeric(id)), 
                    ".csv", sep="")

## I tried for a whole day, like about 16 hours, to R'ify
## this code using lapply, sapply, apply etc to read all of 
## the required CSV files into one data structure.  I managed
## to get the lot into memory, but not in a format that
## was readily usable.  lapply gave me a list of lists
## with no names, and did not like mean() AT ALL, unlist()
## made it worse.  sapply did much the same deal.  I tried
## the coerce functions as.data.bleh to no avail....

## Initialise variables

    N           <- 0
    this_sum    <- 0
    total       <- 0
    mean        <- 0

## SUCK in the data set
# and calculate means

    for (file in files) {
        data        <- read.csv(file)
        data        <- clean_table(data,pollutant)
        N           <- N + nrow(data)
        this_sum    <- sum(data[,pollutant])
        total       <- total + this_sum
    }
    mean <- round(total/N, 3)
    print(mean)
}
